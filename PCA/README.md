## PCA Notes

### PCA

Principal components analysis (PCA) of gray fox SNPs. The first PC axis split the eastern (yellow) and western (all blues) lineages and explained 20.1% of the variance. The second PC axis explained 2.7% of the variance and revealed population structure within the western cluster (shades of blue). Each circle represents an individual fox colored by its geographic location (California = light blue, Nevada = blue-gray, Colorado/New Mexico = blue-green, Texas = dark blue, and East = yellow).

### Effects of Thinning

To assess the effects of linkage we implemented the --write-random-snp function in Stacks which only includes one snp per GBS locus. We did not observe any significant changes in the PCA or the strength of the proportion of variance explained.

## PCA

### PCA
<img align="right" src="/PCA/PCA.png" width="800">
Principal components analysis (PCA) of gray fox SNPs. The first PC axis split the eastern (yellow) and western (all blues) lineages and explained 20.1% of the variance. The second PC axis explained 2.7% of the variance and revealed population structure within the western cluster (shades of blue). Each circle represents an individual fox colored by its geographic location (California = light blue, Nevada = blue-gray, Colorado/New Mexico = blue-green, Texas = dark blue, and East = yellow).
